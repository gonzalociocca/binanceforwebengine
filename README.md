Requirements:
Your webengine has to be on the %root% folder of your website (example: %root%/api/binance/success.php)

Check:
See if your api is set up correctly, go to your http://yourwebsite.com/api/binance/success.php if it throws an error it probably is not working as it should(normal response is Wrong Status)
